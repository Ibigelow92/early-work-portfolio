# early-work-portfolio
This is a starting project for UCD Code Bootcamp, done both for the purpose of cementing HTML and CSS skills while also showing off some of my work up to this point. Hopefully I look back at this portfolio some time in the future and chuckle at how much more I know then than at this point!
